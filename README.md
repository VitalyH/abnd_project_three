Quiz App

Task: to complete this project, you'll need to design a quiz layout and implement it in an app. The quiz can be about any topic of your choice, and you are encouraged to create one on a topic you find personally interesting.

My comment: it's Harry Potter time! Extra functionality: floating "Reset" button. Tested on Nexus 5X (emulator, API 27) and Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (live, API 19).

SPECS

Layout 

App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry. Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer. App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
Text sizes are defined in sp
Lengths are defined in dp
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup. If applicable, the app uses nested ViewGroups to reduce the complexity of the layout.

The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.

Functionality

The code runs without errors. Each question has a correct answer. Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once. The app contains at least one if/else statement. The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz. The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count (Note: When applicable, in the grading logic remember to check that the correct answers are checked AND the incorrect answers are not checked).

Code Readability

All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
